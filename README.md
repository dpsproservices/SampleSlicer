# SampleSlicer
Use the open source python pydub to process a directory or folder full of raw recordings
and slice them into seperated individual 16bit stereo .wav files
in a 2nd folder.
Then normalize all those wave files in the 2nd folder into a 3rd folder
for further processing.

# Setup
Install ffmpeg with brew

Then install PyDub with pip

# Run

Copy or move all the raw recordings into the folder specified in globals.py
Create the 2nd and 3rd folders specified in glboals.py where the files will be output

python slicer.py
